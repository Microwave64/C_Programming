In this task, I have dived into dynamical programming in C with implementation of doubly linked-list.
I have created an imaginary Cache system according to given inputs.
Cache creator code, the3.c, works as basic version of cache in computer science.
Thanks to task, I acquired deep knowledge about memory management and computer architecture.
By changing the input, you can create a different cache, and apply various operations on it via funcion call changes main function.
Thanks for examine my code.
Please do not hesitate to contact me via mail.
