In this task, I have dived into dynamical programming in C with implementation of doubly linked-list.
Additionally, thanks to task, I acquired deep knowledge about memory management and computer architecture.
I was expected to created an imaginary Cache system according to given inputs.
Cache creator code, the3.c, works as basic version of cache in computer science.
The main function has some function calls and operation in cache.
By changing the input, you can create a different cache, and apply various operations on it via funcion call changes main function.
Thanks for examine my code.
Please do not hesitate to contact me via mail.
